# Andamio Discord Bot

A reusable TypeScript Discord bot that brings Andamio on-chain credentials into
a Discord community. A member proves they control an Andamio access-token alias
with `/login`, sees their earned credentials inline with `/credentials`, and is
automatically granted Discord roles based on those credentials.

It does what a plain wallet-verification bot cannot: it reads each member's
Andamio credentials from the authenticated Andamio API and gates Discord roles
on them — **with no wallet handling by adopters.** The bot never touches a
wallet, seed phrase, or private key. Login is delegated to the hosted Andamio
app; the bot stores a Discord-id ↔ alias link plus the member's login JWT, and
reads that member's dashboard with it.

This repo is a **template**: clone it, set your config, and run it against your
own Discord guild and an Andamio (preprod) deployment with **no code changes**.

## What the bot does

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/login` | Replies with an ephemeral link to the Andamio hosted login. The member authenticates in their browser; the app redirects the result back to the bot, which stores `discord_id ↔ alias`. Re-running it re-links. |
| `/logout` | Unlinks the member's Discord account from their Andamio alias. |
| `/credentials` | Shows the member the Andamio credentials they have earned, grouped by course (ephemeral). Personal inventory only — what they hold. |
| `/available` | Lists the credentials this server gates channels on, each marked ✅/⬜ for whether the member holds it, with a link to earn the ones they lack. Works before connecting (shows the catalog without the ✓/✗ overlay). |
| `/check` | Re-reads the member's Andamio credentials live, updates their roles, and reports which gated credentials they hold and which they still need (with earn links). One command to both refresh roles and see where you stand. |

**How it works**

- `/login` reuses the Andamio app's hosted CLI auth flow (`/auth/cli`) to prove
  a Discord member controls an access-token alias, then stores
  `discord_id ↔ alias` plus the member's user JWT. No wallet logic lives in this
  repo.
- Reads run on the authenticated Andamio API, `POST /api/v2/user/dashboard`,
  with two headers: `X-API-Key` (the operator key — see `ANDAMIO_API_KEY`)
  authenticates the bot, and `Authorization: Bearer <member JWT>` selects whose
  dashboard to read. The dashboard is scoped to the JWT's user.
- Configurable rules (`role-mappings.json`) map earned credentials to Discord
  roles. The bot grants and revokes **only** the roles it manages.
- Roles re-evaluate on `/login`, on `/check` (on demand), when a member (re)joins
  the guild, and on a periodic background sweep. End-user JWTs expire and cannot
  be refreshed unattended: a member whose JWT has lapsed keeps their current
  roles until they reconnect (the bot shows a one-click **Connect** button on
  `/credentials`, `/available`, and `/check`). The background sweep skips lapsed
  members rather than churning their roles.

The datastore is SQLite (`better-sqlite3`) — file-based, zero-ops.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+** (better-sqlite3 ships prebuilt binaries for current LTS).
- **A Discord application + bot** (created below).
- **An Andamio app + API deployment** to point at (preprod by default), and an
  **operator Andamio API key** (`ANDAMIO_API_KEY`) for the API host.
- **A public https URL** for the bot to receive the login callback (so the
  hosted app can redirect the auth result back). Required for `/login` to
  complete; any tunnel or host that gives you a stable https origin works.

## 1. Create the Discord application + bot

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
   and **New Application**.
2. **General Information** — copy the **Application ID** → `DISCORD_APP_ID`.
3. **Bot** — **Reset Token**, copy it → `DISCORD_TOKEN`. (Treat it like a
   password; never commit it.)
4. **Bot > Privileged Gateway Intents** — enable **Server Members Intent**
   (the bot uses `GuildMembers` to fetch members for role evaluation).
5. **Invite the bot** to your server with the right scopes and permission.
   Use the OAuth2 URL Generator (OAuth2 > URL Generator), or build the URL
   directly:
   - **Scopes:** `bot` and `applications.commands`
   - **Bot permission:** **Manage Roles**

   ```
   https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_APP_ID&scope=bot%20applications.commands&permissions=268435456
   ```
   (`268435456` is the **Manage Roles** permission bit. Replace `YOUR_APP_ID`.)
6. In your server, get the **Server ID** (enable Developer Mode, then right-click
   the server > Copy Server ID) → `GUILD_ID`.

## 2. Configure the environment

Copy the template and fill it in:

```
cp .env.example .env
```

Every variable, what it's for, and an example value:

| Variable | Required | Purpose | Example |
|----------|----------|---------|---------|
| `DISCORD_TOKEN` | yes | Discord bot token | `MTspeyJ...` (from Bot > Reset Token) |
| `DISCORD_APP_ID` | yes | Discord application (client) id | `123456789012345678` |
| `GUILD_ID` | yes | Discord guild (server) id the bot operates in | `987654321098765432` |
| `ANDAMIO_API_BASE_URL` | yes | Andamio API base URL — the authenticated read API (`POST /api/v2/user/dashboard`), no trailing slash | `https://preprod.api.andamio.io` *(mainnet: `https://api.andamio.io`)* |
| `ANDAMIO_API_KEY` | yes | **SECRET.** Operator-level Andamio API key, sent as `X-API-Key`. Authenticates the bot operator (one key per deployment); mainnet keys are prefixed `ant_mn_`. Never commit it — set it in `.env` (gitignored) and as a secret service variable on your host | `ant_mn_…` |
| `APP_LOGIN_BASE_URL` | yes | Andamio app base URL hosting the CLI login flow (`/auth/cli`), no trailing slash | `https://preprod-app.andamio.io` *(preprod — confirm exact host)* |
| `BOT_CALLBACK_BASE_URL` | yes | Public https base URL where the bot receives the auth callback (`GET <this>/callback`); its origin must be in the app's allowlist (see Operating notes), no trailing slash | `https://your-bot-host.example.com` |
| `ROLE_MAPPINGS_PATH` | yes | Path to the role-mappings JSON config | `./config/role-mappings.json` |
| `DB_PATH` | yes | Path to the SQLite database file (created on first run) | `./data/bot.sqlite` |
| `COURSE_DISPLAY_NAMES` | no | `course_id → display name` map (JSON object) used by `/credentials`, `/available`, and `/check` to show friendly course names; falls back to raw course ids if unset/malformed. Independent of `role-mappings.json`. Default `{}` | `{"course_cardano_101":"Cardano 101"}` |
| `GATING_SWEEP_INTERVAL_MS` | no | Interval (ms) for the periodic role-sweep over connected members. Positive number; default 15 min | `900000` |
| `PORT` | no | Port the callback web server listens on. Default 3000 | `3000` |

> The base URLs above use **preprod** placeholders. `ANDAMIO_API_BASE_URL` is the
> API host (`preprod.api.andamio.io` / mainnet `api.andamio.io`), a **different
> host** from `APP_LOGIN_BASE_URL` (the Andamio app, `preprod-app`/`app.andamio.io`).
> `ANDAMIO_API_KEY` is a **secret** — keep it out of git and out of
> `role-mappings.json`; set it locally in `.env` and as a secret service variable
> on your host. `BOT_CALLBACK_BASE_URL` is **your** bot's public origin.

## 3. Configure credential gating (`role-mappings.json`)

This is the one file you edit to decide **which Andamio credential unlocks which
Discord role**. It is **committed to the repo on purpose** — it is config, not a
secret, so it is version-controlled (diffs, review, rollback). `ROLE_MAPPINGS_PATH`
points at it (`./config/role-mappings.json` by default).

> **Forking this bot?** Edit `config/role-mappings.json` directly — that is the
> whole setup. The committed file ships with the Andamio **demo** config (one
> rule gating an "Andamio Developer" channel) using `REPLACE_WITH_…`
> placeholders; swap in your own values and you are done.
> `config/role-mappings.example.json` is a separate, annotated reference showing
> all three rule types — copy from it if you want more rules.

It is a JSON **array** of rules. Each rule grants one `role_id` when its
condition is met. The set of all `role_id`s across rules is the bot's **managed
set** — the *only* roles it ever adds or removes (it never touches a
moderator/booster/etc. role).

### Fields

| Field | Required | What it is | Where to get it |
|---|---|---|---|
| `type` | yes | `enrolled`, `course-complete`, or `credential` (see below) | — |
| `course_id` | yes | The Andamio course the rule keys on | From your Andamio course / the Andamio API |
| `slt_hash` | only for `credential` | The specific credential within the course | From the course's credential definition |
| `role_id` | yes | The Discord role to grant | Discord → enable Developer Mode → right-click the role → Copy Role ID |
| `label` | no | Human name for the gate (e.g. `"Andamio Issuer"`), shown in `/available` and `/check` | You choose it |
| `earn_url` | no | http(s) link to earn what the rule requires | Your course/credential's public page |

### Rule types

- **`enrolled`** — grant `role_id` when the member is enrolled in (or has
  completed) `course_id`.
- **`course-complete`** — grant `role_id` when the member has **completed**
  `course_id`.
- **`credential`** — grant `role_id` when the member has completed `course_id`
  **and** holds the specific credential `slt_hash`. `slt_hash` is **required**.

The two optional fields (`label`, `earn_url`) **never affect gating** — they only
drive the call to action. When `earn_url` is set, `/available` and `/check` show
it to a member who does **not** yet satisfy the rule, so non-holders see exactly
how to unlock the gated channel; `label` names the gate there, falling back to
the course display name when absent.

### The demo config (what ships)

```json
[
  {
    "type": "credential",
    "course_id": "REPLACE_WITH_DEVELOPER_COURSE_ID",
    "slt_hash": "REPLACE_WITH_DEVELOPER_CREDENTIAL_SLT_HASH",
    "role_id": "REPLACE_WITH_DISCORD_ROLE_ID",
    "label": "Andamio Developer",
    "earn_url": "https://app.andamio.io/courses/REPLACE_WITH_DEVELOPER_COURSE_ID"
  }
]
```

Replace the three `REPLACE_WITH_…` values (course id, credential slt hash, and
your Discord role id) and the bot gates that channel on that credential.

### Validation

The config is **strictly validated at startup** and fails fast, naming the
offending rule, on: a non-array top level, an unknown/missing `type`, a missing
`course_id`/`role_id`, a `credential` rule without `slt_hash`, a non-http(s)
`earn_url`, or an empty `label`. A typo can never silently disable gating.

## 4. Install, build, run

```
npm install          # install dependencies
npm run build        # compile TypeScript to dist/
npm start            # run the bot (node dist/index.js)
```

- **Commands register themselves on boot.** On `ClientReady` the bot PUTs its
  current command set (`/login`, `/logout`, `/credentials`, `/available`,
  `/check`) as **guild** commands for your `GUILD_ID` (instant, vs. global
  commands which take up to an hour). So **a deploy is all it takes** to add,
  rename, or remove a command — a removed command disappears on the next boot.
  Registration is best-effort: a transient failure leaves the previously
  registered set working and never takes the bot down.
- `npm run deploy` (optional) runs `src/deploy-commands.ts` to register the same
  set **without** starting the bot — handy when forking or to push a command
  change before the next deploy.
- `npm start` boots the bot and the callback web server together. On a clean
  start it logs the logged-in tag, the registered command count, how many
  roles/rules gating manages, and the sweep interval.

For local development: `npm run dev` runs from source (ts-node) and
`npm run watch` reloads on change. `npm test` runs the suite (vitest);
`npm run lint` runs eslint.

## Operating notes

- **Role ordering — the bot's role must sit ABOVE the roles it manages.**
  Discord only lets a bot add/remove roles that are **lower** than its own
  highest role in the server's role list (Server Settings > Roles). Drag the
  bot's role above every role named in `role-mappings.json`, or grants/revokes
  will silently fail with a permissions error.
- **The bot only ever touches roles it manages.** The managed set is exactly the
  `role_id`s named in your mappings. The evaluator computes a desired-vs-current
  diff scoped to that set, so it never adds or removes any other role a member
  holds. Roles not in the mappings are invisible to the bot.
- **`/login` requires an app-side allowlist change.** The Andamio app's hosted
  login (`/auth/cli`) only redirects the auth result to allowlisted origins. The
  app must be deployed with **`ALLOWED_BOT_CALLBACK_ORIGINS`** including this
  bot's `BOT_CALLBACK_BASE_URL` **origin** (scheme + host + port), or the
  callback is rejected and `/login` never completes. This is a one-line,
  env-gated allowlist entry on the **app side** (it does not broaden to arbitrary
  https — it matches your explicit origin). Coordinate this with whoever operates
  the Andamio app deployment before testing `/login` end-to-end.
- **Unconnected members get no credential roles.** A member must `/login` to earn
  any mapped role; if they `/logout` (or were never linked), the bot removes any
  managed roles they hold on the next evaluation.
- **Re-evaluation timing.** Roles update on `/login`, on `/check` (on demand),
  when a member rejoins, and on the periodic sweep (`GATING_SWEEP_INTERVAL_MS`,
  default 15 min) — for members whose login JWT is still valid.
- **Member JWTs expire; reconnection is one click.** Reads use the member's
  Andamio login JWT, which has a finite lifetime and cannot be refreshed without
  the member. When it lapses, `/credentials`, `/available`, and `/check` reply
  with a **Connect** button (a fresh `/login` link); the background sweep skips
  the member rather than churning their roles, so they keep their current roles
  until they reconnect.
- **The SQLite store holds secrets.** Beyond the `discord_id ↔ alias` link, the
  database persists each member's user JWT. Keep `DB_PATH` on a private,
  persistent volume (and never commit `data/`) — losing it just forces everyone
  to `/login` again; exposing it leaks bearer tokens.
